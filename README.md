### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Anthony!

I am a software engineer and I love exploring languages, technologies and understanding how they work.

- Favourite languages & technologies include: .NET, C#, F# and Rust.
- Socket programming and network protocols is my thing.
- Currently working on Rift, a netty inspired framework for .NET. (I hope I can open source it soon! ðŸ˜Š)
- Also building a CLI time tracking tool using Rust.
- Trying to learn Vim just so I can say "I use Vim by the way".
